# Milestone-Game - Star Reach

Star reach is a platformer with a simple goal of reaching the top and collecting all stars in the game.

I was inspired by the idea of land animals having a fascination with the sky and wanted to create something that showed the story of a fox being able to "reach the stars"

# How to play

Use the A and D keys to move left and right and use the W key to jump. Navigate around the platforms and game area to collect all 8 stars
